# Voices of Salvation

A set of tools for extracting and labeling audio for Tales of Symphonia with the intent to generate English audio for unvoiced lines via ML techniques.

## What is this?

This is a repository containing tools to extract existing voice lines from the Windows release of the game and label them with character and script information, such that they could be fed to a retargetable speech synthesis system to generate audio for unvoiced lines in the game, especially the skits.

## Why "Voices of Salvation"?

It's a play on a structure from the game, the Tower of Salvation. Given the goal of producing voiced lines of the main characters that save the world, it made sense to call it Voices of Salvation.
